## LAB 36 -  Application State with Redux

## Description :

* ### an application that will power an online storefront that will allow our users to browse our product offerings by category, place items in their shopping cart, and check-out when they are ready to make their purchase

##  store-front App Phase 1:

### In Phase 1, setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and basic behaviors. This initial build sets up the file structure and state management so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner

The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

1.  As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products

2. As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category

3. As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence
